x_test:   all  measurements  related to test cases
              created by reading the data from X_test.txt file


x_train:  all  measurements  related to  train cases
               created by reading data from X_train.txt


subject_test:  subject measurements  for test cases
                created by reading data from  subject_test.txt 
named its column by "subject"


subject_train:   subject  measurements  for train cases
               created by reading data from  subject_train.txt, named its column by "subject"


y_test:   activities for test cases, named its column by "ActivityLabel" 
             created by reading  data from  y_test.txt


y_train:  activities for train cases, named its column by "ActivityLabel"  
              created by reading  data from  y_train.txt


testData: merged all the data related to test cases including y_test,subject_test and x_test


trainData: merged all the data related to test cases including y_train,subject_train and x_train


Data :  merged testData and trainData


n : a table of the features including the index and name of feature 

 
Names: the second column of table n for extracting the name of feature ( to have them as character type, we have used as.character)


IncludeMean: all the feature names or column names including "mean" 


IncludeStd: all the feature names or column names including "std"


IndexMean: a vector of  indices of features including "mean" 

 
IndexStd: a vector of indices of features including "std" 

 
Index_Mean_Std: a vector of indices of features including "mean" or "std" 

 
Data_Mean_Std: all measurements  on the mean and standard deviation


activity_labels: a table including activities and activity labels. Activity labels are from 1 to 6, named its columns by "Labels","Activity"


Activity: a vector of activity name


DF:  resulted from adding two columns "activity label" and "subject" to Data_Mean_Std
       ( value stored in column "activity label" is replaced by the name of activity) 


FinalData: a data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, it has 180 rows and 81 columns.
